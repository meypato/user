## Database Schema
**See**: `docs/databases/database.md` for complete documentation

**Core Entities**: Profiles → Buildings → Rooms → Subscriptions → Payments/Reviews

---

## Business Logic

### User Management
- **Multi-role system**: Tenant, Owner, Agent, Admin
- **APST Classification**: Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe status
- **3-tier verification**: Document → Police → Profile verification
- **Cultural compatibility**: Tribe/profession-based filtering

### Property System
- **Buildings**: Property listings with photos, amenities, location
- **Rooms**: Individual rental units with pricing and availability
- **Access control**: Exception-based filtering (inclusion by default)
- **Geographic hierarchy**: State → City organization

### Subscription Management  
- **One active subscription per room**: Business rule enforcement
- **Monthly payment tracking**: One payment per month per subscription
- **Rental agreements**: Digital document management
- **Payment history**: Complete transaction audit trail

### Review System
- **Verified reviews**: Linked to actual tenancy subscriptions
- **Rating system**: 1-5 stars with photo support
- **Community feedback**: Helpfulness tracking

---

## Navigation Architecture

### **Clean Screen Separation**
- **HomeScreen**: Pure search/welcome content with drawer + bottom nav
- **RentScreen**: Pure room listings content with drawer + bottom nav  
- **ProfileScreen**: Pure profile management content with drawer + bottom nav
- **No embedded navigation logic**: Each screen focuses solely on content

### **Shared Navigation Components**
- **AppDrawer**: Beautiful sidebar with real profile data, menu items, and theme toggle
- **CustomBottomNavigation**: Smart routing component that handles all tab navigation
- **Self-contained**: Navigation widgets handle their own routing logic

### **Navigation Flow**
```
App Launch:
└── Splash Screen (/splash) → Auto-navigation after 3s
    ├── → /home (if authenticated)
    └── → /login (if not authenticated)

Bottom Navigation:
├── Home (index 0) → /home (HomeScreen)
├── Rooms (index 1) → /rent (RentScreen) → /rent/:rentId (RentDetailScreen)
├── Building (index 2) → /building (BuildingScreen)
├── Favorites (index 3) → /favorites (FavoritesScreen)
└── Profile (index 4) → /profile (ProfileScreen)

Drawer Navigation:
├── Home → /home
├── Rooms → /rent
├── Building → /building
├── Profile → /profile
├── Settings → /settings
└── Secondary items (Favorites → /favorites, Notifications, Help)

Nested Routes:
└── /rent (RentScreen)
    └── /:rentId (RentDetailScreen) # Proper parent-child relationship
```

### **Architecture Benefits**
- **Single Responsibility**: Screens handle content, widgets handle navigation
- **Easy Maintenance**: Add new screens without touching navigation logic
- **Consistent UX**: Same navigation experience across all screens
- **Clean Code**: No duplicate navigation logic or mixed concerns

---

## UI/UX Design System

### **Modern Floating Navigation**
- **Compact Design**: 60px height (reduced from 85px) with pill-shaped floating design
- **Smart Layout**: 20px margins create floating effect above content
- **Simplified Icons**: Removed active indicator dots for cleaner appearance
- **Theme Responsive**: Adapts colors automatically for light/dark modes
- **Content Flow**: Uses `extendBody: true` to allow content behind transparent navigation

### **CRITICAL: Bottom Navigation Screen Layout Pattern**
⚠️ **For ALL screens with bottom navigation, use this exact pattern to avoid visual cutouts:**

```dart
Scaffold(
  extendBody: true,
  body: SingleChildScrollView(  // ❌ NO SafeArea wrapper here!
    child: Column(
      children: [
        SizedBox(height: MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top), // Status bar padding
        // ... your content ...
        const SizedBox(height: 100), // Bottom navigation spacing
      ],
    ),
  ),
  bottomNavigationBar: const CustomBottomNavigation(...),
)
```

**❌ WRONG Pattern (creates cutouts):**
```dart
body: SafeArea(  // This conflicts with extendBody: true
  child: SingleScrollView(
    padding: EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 100), // Root padding causes issues
    child: Column(...)
  )
)
```

**✅ CORRECT Pattern:**
- Remove `SafeArea` wrapper from body
- Use manual status bar padding: `SizedBox(height: MediaQuery.of(context).padding.top)`
- Add bottom spacing inside content: `SizedBox(height: 100)`
- Content flows naturally behind floating navigation

**✅ Successfully Applied To:**
- ProfileScreen, BuildingScreen, FavoritesScreen (all cutout-free!)
- RentScreen uses similar pattern with ListView padding

### **Rent Screen Optimization**
- **Horizontal Room Cards**: Large 140x140px left-side photos with details on right
- **Compact Layout**: Removed SafeArea constraints for full-screen content flow
- **Smart Scrolling**: 100px bottom padding allows scrolling past floating navigation
- **Modern Card Design**: Subtle shadows, green price chips, optimized spacing
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger tap targets and readable text sizes

### **App Bar Consistency**
- **Theme-Aware Colors**: Proper text/icon colors for light mode visibility
- **Consistent Styling**: 20px font size, 600 weight across all screens
- **Clean Design**: Zero elevation with surface-matching backgrounds

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Efficient Layouts**: Removed unnecessary containers and SafeArea constraints
- **Smooth Animations**: 200ms transitions for navigation state changes
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized widget rebuilds and state management

### **Modern Homepage Design**
